### Name recogniser checks if your name has been uttered. If your name was present in the sentence or someone called your name then it would automatically trigger an email and will send to your mail id. 
It is a very handy feauture when you have joined a meeting and you're away with your phone or you are lazy like me and fallen asleep in the middle of the long meeting. Then you can see your mail notifications on your phone and check if someone mentioned your name during the meeting. It will also send the additional words that was spoken along with your name. 

#### NOTE : Its not very prompt and works with active internet connection. The code uses google speech to tezt recognition.
